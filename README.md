# Mips32_Processor
In this Project I have Implemented the Mips32 Processor using Pipelining Technique which will help in increasing the Speed and Efficiency of the Processor.
<br>
For the Processor I have used Reduced Instruction Set.
<br>
<br>
Functions Present in the Processor are Given Below
<br>
**ADD** (Addition of Two Values Present in Two Registers and store the result in a third register)
<br>
**SUB** (Substraction of Two Values Present in Two Registers and store the result in a third register)
<br>
**AND** (Logical and operation of two values Present in two registers and store it into third register)
<br>
**OR** (Logical OR operation of two values Present in two registers and store it into third register)
<br>
**SLT** (It will select Lesser Value among two values stored in the registers and siores the lesser value in the destination register)
<br>
**MUL** (Multiplication Of Two numbers stored in two registers and store the result in the third register)
<br>
**ADDI**,**SUBI**,**SLTI** (These will Add,Substract,select lesser value respectively from a value stored in a register and an immediate value)
<br>
