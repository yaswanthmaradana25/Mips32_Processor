# Mips32_Processor
In this Project I have Implemented the Mips32 Processor using Pipelining Technique which will help in increasing the Speed and Efficiency of the Processor.
<br>
For the Processor I have used Reduced Instruction Set.
<br>
Mips32_Processor has 32 inbuilt registers ranging from R0 to R31.
<br>
<br>
Functions Present in the Processor are Given Below
<br>
**ADD** (Addition of Two Values Present in Two Registers and store the result in a third register)
<br>
**SUB** (Substraction of Two Values Present in Two Registers and store the result in a third register)
<br>
**AND** (Logical and operation of two values Present in two registers and store it into third register)
<br>
**OR** (Logical OR operation of two values Present in two registers and store it into third register)
<br>
**SLT** (It will select Lesser Value among two values stored in the registers and siores the lesser value in the destination register)
<br>
**MUL** (Multiplication Of Two numbers stored in two registers and store the result in the third register)
<br>
**ADDI**,**SUBI**,**SLTI** (These will Add,Substract,select lesser value respectively from a value stored in a register and an immediate value)
<br>
**LW** (Calculates the  address of the destination register and stores the value in that register)
<br>
**SW** (Calculates the address of the destination Memory address and stores the value in the memory location)
<br>
**BEQZ** (Jumps to the next instruction when the value stored in the register is zero)
<br>
**BNEQZ** (Jumps to the next instruction when the value stored in the register is not equal to zero)
**HLT** (Stops the Execution Of Next Instruction)
